If youâ€™ve never had an ITIN before and are submitting an application for the first time, you must bring your complete original tax return(s) for which the ITIN is needed. Return preparation service is no longer offered at this office. There are exceptions to the requirement to include a U.S. federal tax return. See Form W-7 Instructions for more information. If you claim one of these exceptions, you must submit the documentation required instead of a tax return.
